# Valorant Meta Data Analysis Epidode 4: Act 3
Exploratory data analysis winrate factors in Valorant game based on Agent, Weapon, Rank and Regional with the aim of creating the Most Effective Tactic Available
# Background
Valorant is a tactical first-person shooter game developed and published by Riot Games. The game was released on June 2, 2020 and has since gained rapid popularity, especially among players looking for a gaming experience that combines strategy and individual skill. Therefore, determining the best META or Most Effective Tactics Available is needed for a team to achieve victory.
# Problem Statement: This is imagination or a fictional story
I am a data analyst from the RRQ team in the Valorant division. Team RRQ is experiencing defeat in all competitions. By identifying winrate factors based on Agent, Weapon, Rank and Region, the aim is to create a META that can help the RRQ Team increase the winrate by 30% over the next 1 year in all competition events so that it can increase self-confidence for players and teams.
# Conclusion
For Team RRQ:
1. The choice of weapon for each player is very important because it can affect the number of kills.
2. The best method to kill opposing players is by using the headshot method. So the RRQ Team can focus on training its players to do headshot practice.
3. Rank affects player and team performance. If you want to create a professional team with competent players, it is recommended to look for players with the highest rating (Radiant).
4. Choosing an agent can increase your chances of winning. Like choosing to use jett, reyna, and chamber. Because these three agents have the highest number of wins compared to other agents.
5. And finally, the strategy that can be applied to the team is to deal high damage to the enemy. So this will automatically increase the team's round score.
